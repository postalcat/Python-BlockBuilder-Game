# Python-BlockBuilder-Game
A basic game that runs on ursina engine that allows you to create and destroy small structures.
Textures are under MIT aswell so copyright free(but ugly)


#Make sure to install ursina(pip install ursina)


IF USING MACOS/DARWIN:

Download the fixed ursina file and replace your previous with this one; as it has darwin cursor enabled properly.

(some other files than /ursina/mouse.py changed as well like signal reception functions so just replacing that alone doesn't work
